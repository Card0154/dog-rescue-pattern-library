The banner is used to draw attention towards the <i>call to action</i>, and is to quickly connect clients with the profiles of the dogs available to be fostered.

- The <i>call to action</i> banner is only to be used on the landing page, and only at the top of the page.
- It is meant to be the first image the eyes can rest upon when visiting the website.
- It is only meant to express how easy it is to connect with the available animals, and should not contain ads.

The <i>call to action</i> banner should be large, and should not compete with other elements on the homepage for attention.
