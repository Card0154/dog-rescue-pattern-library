    <p class="pad-top-double pad-fix">In order to make the process fair to all dogs, Loyal Rescue does not provide any features to aid with filtering by breed. Breed filtering simply based on preference creates a disadvantage for the dogs that are mixed breeds.</p>
    <p class="pad-top-eighth pad-fix">As a foster-based rescue, we firmly believe that this process should be as open as possible for the dogs; however, Loyal rescue is not here to make promises to families that they will find the exact breed that they want.</p>
    <p class="pad-top-eighth pad-fix"><b>Please do not be offended by this, as it is just a precaution to ensure that people are adopting these dogs for the right reasons.</b></p>
