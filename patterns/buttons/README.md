The buttons use our primary colour to draw attention to the content and highlight it. Each button has a specific purpose and should be used for:

- The regular buttons are for forms, and where the background is a lighter; providing some contrast and making it stand out.
- The light buttons are for darker areas, where the content needs something to help it stand out.
- The ghost button are exclusively for the hero banner.
- The small ghost button is exclusively for cards.

Pairing these with different 'font-size' classes to create some variation in button sizes.
