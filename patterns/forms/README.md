Each form field is used to make up the larger part of the form. They all have particular styles when used in different situations:

- The login form is presented on a single line, and all elements are kept as flat in colour as possible, in order to put them over different backgrounds.
- The general options will all be placed within the same form family. They will all be styled the same, with the exception of individual characteristics for each field type.
- The last form style is the radial buttons which will be used to filter out animal traits when looking to adopt.

Pairing these with different 'font-size' classes to create some variation in button sizes.
