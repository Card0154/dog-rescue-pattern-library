    The secondary typeface is a thinner sans-serif with little weight variation in the strokes to create a solid set of text for longer entries.

colors:
  primary: |
    The primary colours represent the nature of the work being done at Loyal Rescue. The soft blues are inviting, but reveal the level of sadness associated with animal adoption. These colours convey the emotions of the abandoned animals and the caretakers who have to care for animals which might never be adopted. Use them for headers, buttons, and emphasis.
  accent: |
    The accent colours are simply to break up the rich primary colours and provide contrast. Use them for body copy, reversed text, and different shades as section dividers.
  neutral: |
    The neutral colour is the variation of the accent colours which will primarily be used to break up sections of content. It is an off-white, which will provide easier readability and organization of content.
